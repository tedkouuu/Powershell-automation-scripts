Collection of PowerShell scripts I used at work to automate common Windows admin tasks—provisioning, auditing, and secure remote access.

Scripts

Activate administrator sch.txt – Enable/disable the built-in Administrator with optional password + logging (supports scheduling).

Find files and Directories.txt – Search by name/date/size and export results to CSV.

God Script.txt – Reusable helpers (logging, elevation checks, safe error handling) shared across scripts.

Language and Region.txt – Set system locale, keyboard layouts, time zone, and regional formats.

List all users sch.txt – Inventory local users/groups (state, last logon, memberships) and export.

Locadmin.txt – Create/update a least-privileged local admin and enforce membership/policies.

ssh service install.txt – Install & configure OpenSSH Server on Windows (firewall + key auth).
